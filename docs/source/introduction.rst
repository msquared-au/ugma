Introduction
============

This guide is designed to help you back up your Android data online using
a hosting service of your choice.

Goals
-----

Using a hosting service of your choosing:

#. Back up your Android device (enable online backup and
   restore of a single Android device)
#. Synchronise your Android device (enable synchronisation
   of your data & files between Android devices)
#. Access your Android device's data online (enable online
   access to your data and files)

The hosting service could be internal (at your home or work,
for example) or external (with any online service provider).

If you host it internally (at home or work, for example), setting
up external access is optional.  It might be sufficient for you
that you can only keep your device synchronised and backed up when
you go to work or go home.

Hosting
-------

You should be able to set up online backup/sync/access of your device
data to any of the following hosting arrangements:

- Any generic LAMP hosting environment (at home or "on the internet")
- A virtual machine instance dedicated to your device (or devices)
- A virtual machine instance shared among family members, a group of
  friends, or with work colleagues
- A physical machine for just you or for many people
- An online service set up to sell or rent UGMA services to people

Overview
--------

This guide lists many collections of data and files that
an Android user will want to back up, and lists ways that
the data and/or files might be backed up.
