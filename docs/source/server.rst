Server setup
============

Assuming you have a standard LAMP_ setup, here's what else you should install
and/or configure in order to back up your Android device to it:

- IMAP email access (for backing up SMS message and call logs)
- OwnCloud_ (for syncing calendar and contacts, and for many other things)
- Git (for saving passwords via the pass_-compatible PwdStore_ Android app)
